1 provide the details of the dataset, 2 train a machine learning model by calling an algorithm from the machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, and save the model so that it can be called later. You can save a model with scikit-learn built-in functionality such as https://scikit-learn. org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html. 3 implement a machine learning algorithm by yourself, train a model with the algorithm, and save the model so that it can be called later; 4 compare the train error and test error of the two models; 5 enable the user to query the saved models with e.g., an index of the test dataset.
